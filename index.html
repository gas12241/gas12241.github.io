        I grew up in the south side of Seattle and went to high school in
        downtown Seattle. After graduating, I crossed the street to Seattle
        University for my undergrad degree and got my Bachelor's in Spanish and
        English Literature. I am now a Master's in Computer Science candidate at
        Northeastern University and will be graduating in May 2024.

          I Graduated from Seattle Academy in 2016 and a year later, I was asked
          to come back and help the soccer program play "The Right Way". Ever
          since then I've been coaching both in the Upper and Middle School,
          assisting and leading teams in Ultimate Frisbee, Basketball, and
          Soccer. <br />
          <br />
          I also worked as a Middle School Coordinator in the 2020 - 2021 school
          year. I assisted students who were struggling during online-only
          classes and helped the transition between online only and hybrid
          classes be as seamless as possible.
